Description: This program contains the code for creation
 of a child process and attach a pipe to it.
	 The child will send messages through the pipe
	 which will then be sent to standard output.

Explanation of the zombie process
(point 5 of "To be completed" in the assignment):

 In linux, a child process should notify its parent process once it has completed its execution and has exited. 
 Then the parent process will get the notification and it would remove the process from process table. 
 However, if the parent process is unable to read the process status from its child process which the child process has executed,
 it wonâ€™t be able to remove the process from memory. As a result, the process being dead still present in the process table.
 This is called zombine process.
 In other words,zombie process is a process which it has already finished the execution but still has entry in the process table.

	the standard output (df 1). Finish when no data can
